#### Synopsis:
This project conducts natural language processing (NLP) analysis on Twitter airline tweets from part of February 2015 in R and Python.

#### Motivation:
I wrote this project to experiment and learn about NLP in R and Python.

#### Contents:
The R and Python analyses are located in the 'R' and 'Python' branches respectively.
The dataset ('Airline-Sentiment-2-w-AA.csv') is included in both branches.

#### Dataset Details:
I use the 'Airline Twitter sentiment' dataset obtained at the URL below. To find the dataset, search for 'Airline' on the page.
https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/

Specifically, I use the 16,000 row dataset uploaded on February 12, 2015 by CrowdFlower.
I assume the upload date is incorrect as the data includes tweets from after 2/12/2015...
Note that the actual dataset only appears to contain 14,640 rows.
I'm not sure where the discrepancy between actual rows and rows stated on the website comes from, but it doesn't affect my analysis.
This dataset is a scrape of Twitter of data from part of February 2015.
The included tweets are about major US airlines.
Contributors were asked to classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").
The tweet classification provides 'answers' for sentiment analysis, allowing me to conduct more interesting analysis and prediction.
