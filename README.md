#### Synopsis:
This project conducts natural language processing (NLP) analysis on Twitter airline tweets from part of February 2015 in R and Python.

#### Motivation:
I wrote this project to experiment and learn about NLP in R and Python.

#### Contents:
The R and Python analyses are located in the 'R' and 'Python' branches respectively. <br />
The dataset ('Airline-Sentiment-2-w-AA.csv') is included in both branches.

#### Dataset Details:
I use the 'Airline Twitter sentiment' dataset obtained at the URL below. To find the dataset, search for 'Airline' on the page. <br />
https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/

Specifically, I use the 16,000 row dataset uploaded on February 12, 2015 by CrowdFlower. <br />
I assume the upload date is incorrect as the data includes tweets from after 2/12/2015... <br />
Note that the actual dataset only appears to contain 14,640 rows. <br />
I'm not sure where the discrepancy between actual rows and rows stated on the website comes from, but it doesn't affect my analysis. <br />
This dataset is a scrape of Twitter of data from part of February 2015. <br />
The included tweets are about major US airlines. <br />
Contributors were asked to classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). <br />
The tweet classification provides 'answers' for sentiment analysis, allowing me to conduct more interesting analysis and prediction.
